# Air-Quality-Analyzer
We thought to develop this device because of increasing tremendous amount of air pollution, gas cylinder leakages, factory gas leakages, increasing diseases like asthma, skin problems etc. So using this device we can measure quality of air, analyze sensor's data and predict air quality levels. This device can establish on every gas cylinder default to protect our lives.It is cheap in cost and very easy to use. If any gas leakages from cylinder then the amount of gas would increase and detected by the device and send this increased gas data to directly smartphone through GSM(Global System for Mobile communications), so that particular person will go to the place and check cylinder carefully and save many lives.
